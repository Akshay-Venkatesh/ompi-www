$abstract = "This paper describes the implementation, usage and 
experience with the MPI performance revealing extension interface
(Peruse) into the Open MPI implementation.  While the PMPI-interface
allows timing MPI-functions through wrappers, it can not provide
MPI-internal information on MPI-states and lower-level network
performance.  We introduce the general design criteria of the
interface implementation and analyze the overhead generated by this
functionality.  To support performance evaluation of large-scale
applications, tools for visualization are imperative.  We extend the
tracing library of the Paraver-toolkit to support tracing
Peruse-events and show how this helps detecting performance
bottlenecks.  A test-suite and a real-world application are traced and
visualized using Paraver.";
