<p>User and development questions will probably get the fastest
response on the <a href="lists/">mailing lists</a>.  The mailing lists
are also the best way to keep informed of Open MPI software
releases.</p>

<p>Vendor inquiries and questions about joining the Open MPI project
should be directed to the <a href="lists/ompi.php">Open MPI
development list</a>.</p>
